# 👋 Hi, I’m Lasse

I’m a software architect and developer with a passion for clean design, automation, and systems that actually make life easier.  
Most of my days are spent deep in code — building integrations, shaping architectures, and experimenting with new ideas.

This blog is my personal space to share notes, prototypes, and random tech thoughts.  
Expect a mix of:

- 🧩 Code snippets and implementation tricks  
- ⚙️ Architecture and integration patterns  
- 🧠 Lessons learned from real projects  
- 💬 Occasional reflections on technology, teams, and creativity  

I’m not trying to create polished tutorials — just honest write-ups and explorations of things I find interesting or useful.

## 🧰 Tech I enjoy working with
- **ServiceNow**, automation, and workflow design  
- **JavaScript**, **Python**, **PHP**, **PowerShell** and scripting for integrations  
- **Azure**, **GitHub Actions**, and modern DevOps pipelines  
- Building internal tools and apps that help teams work smarter
